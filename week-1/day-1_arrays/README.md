# Solution logic
```if [1, 2, 3, 4] and target = 5
   since  1 + 4(in the list) = 5,
   then 5 - 1 = 4, also 5 - 4 = 1

   so store 4 which is (5 - 1) inside of a dict together with its index and search for 1 (5 - 4) which would be the only other number that can add itself to 4 (1 + 4 = 5) int the list to give 5(the target)
```
